You are designing a high-performance data-driven marketplace directory for the global lithium supply chain. 

Context:
- Target users: Procurement professionals, mining companies, materials traders, battery manufacturers seeking lithium products and suppliers
- Business model: Commission-based marketplace with curated suppliers, pricing intelligence, and sourcing deal brokerage
- Revenue: Middleman cuts on transactions and subscription tiers for premium supplier data

Design Requirements:

PAGE 1: Search & Discovery Interface
- Hero section with prominent search bar ("Find Lithium Suppliers & Products")
- Filter sidebar with multi-select options: Product Type (raw lithium, lithium compounds, processed ore), Purity Level (99%, 99.5%, 99.9%), Price Range, Location/Region, Supplier Verification Tier (Gold/Silver/Bronze badges)
- Results grid showing: Supplier Logo, Company Name, Verification Badge, Price Per Unit, Average Rating, Quick View Button
- Inline comparison checkbox for side-by-side supplier comparison
- Pagination and sorting options (Price Low→High, Newest, Most Verified)

PAGE 2: Supplier Profile Detail
- Header: Company logo, name, verification status, overall rating (5-star), # of transactions, response time
- Key sections: Product Specifications (detailed table format), Pricing Tiers (bulk discounts visible), Certifications/Compliance, Customer Reviews (recent reviews with dates)
- Trust Indicators: Years in business, Verified badge explanation, Security certifications
- CTA buttons: "Request Quote" (prominent), "Schedule Telebuy" (video call + DocuSign integration button)
- "View Similar Suppliers" carousel at bottom

PAGE 3: Telebuy Flow (Integration Layer)
- Minimal interface for video call scheduler + document signing
- Show: Meeting time selector, Embedded Zoom/Calendly picker, "Initiate DocuSign" button
- Post-signature: Payment processing UI (show commission structure transparently: "Our fee: 3-5% of transaction")
- Order summary before final confirmation

Design Style:
- Professional, trustworthy aesthetic (think LinkedIn + B2B SaaS)
- Color palette: Deep blue (#003D82) for primary, Gold (#D4AF37) for premium/verified indicators, Clean whites and light grays
- Typography: Clear hierarchy, sans-serif (Inter/Poppins style)
- Micro-interactions: Hover effects on supplier cards, smooth filter transitions, loading states for data-heavy sections
- Mobile-first responsive design that works seamlessly on tablets and desktops

Data-Aware Features:
- Make product cards responsive to sample supplier data (create mock dataset: 15-20 suppliers with varying product types, prices, ratings)
- Filter logic that actually filters the grid based on selections
- Comparison feature that creates a side-by-side table when 2+ suppliers selected
- Conditional visibility: Show "Bulk Discount" badge only for suppliers with quantity tiers

Make this production-ready with clean code structure, proper spacing using auto-layout, and interactive hover states throughout.
